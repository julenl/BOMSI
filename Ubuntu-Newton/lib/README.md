This is the "lib" folder inside the bomsi root dir.
It contains all the functions and scripts used by BOMSI.

The files have different prefixes, indicating the intended target for their execution.

- The files starting with "l_" are supposed to be executed in the local machine,
while building the ISO images or virtual environment.

- The files starting with "t_" are meant to be executed on the target machines,
or the ones that are going to be running the actual OpenStack installation.
