Liberty on Ubuntu 14.04

## Introduction
BOMSI provides a way to get a system looking exactly the same as it should after following step by step the documentation on docs.openstack.org.

This version is a "beta", which does not include as many functionalities as the CentOS one (such as the GUI or the pendrive creator), but it should install OpenStack more or less OK.

## Usage

Build a 2 node system:

  # Download the files
  git clone https://github.com/julenl/BOMSI.git
  cd BOMSI/Ubuntu-Liberty/

  # Execute the command
  ./bomsi-iso.sh -n=1.controller
  # and
  ./bomsi-iso.sh -n=1.compute1
  

(* BOMSI is a project created voluntarily, without any waranty or responsability from the, so far, single author. However, if you need some help with getting it running for testing purposes, just ask.)

## Open issues
- When starting the VM the ubuntu menu does not set automatically to the node, so one has to chose it by hand (for compute1, ...) otherwise it boots automatically form the controller

- Something wrong with neutron
